---

<img class="ui image" src="/images/puzzle.png">

The puzzle game consists of a picture which are divided by a 3 x 3 grid. Each box in this grid is a part of the picture except one of 
them and the goal is to correctly order the pieces. Only pieces right next to empty one is able to be moved. 

This personal project is my first Java Project I created to test myself. I learned many techniques and skills related to Java and GUI's in general. Like how to animate using Java swing timer and Threads, and learning that one Threads is better because it's more effective and precise on frames per second.

This project is very similar to many other games like this. I only used it to understand how GUI's work.
