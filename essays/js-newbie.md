## Thoughts on JavaScript

  This is the first time that I ever used JavaScript and I'm loving it so far. It's fast and easy to understand compared to Java and C. A first time programmer would probably understand JavaScript way easier then both Java and C. But I realized that you can also make easy mistakes here as well. Because JavaScript gets rid of many redundant coding such as naming all the variables by using let, it opens up many opportunities for coders to make mistake if they are not careful. But I do really like JavaScript so far and I hope to learn more technical aspects of the language later on. And that I do think in the right hands, JavaScript is a good language program. 
 
## WODs were easy to code but hard to solve
  
   The problem I had with the WODs were thinking of how to solve the problems. I feel that once I know how to solve the problem then I can easily implement it in coding. So when doing WODs, I learned to take my time in how I'm approaching the problem rather then immediatly typing the code out. Once I have a general idea I can begin coding and working on fixing the bugs. I find the WODs to be useful in that they make us practice solving problems effciently through practice and repetition. I think for the most part, I like the stressful environment that comes with WODs because I make us learn faster and keeps us on edge and focused. 
   
## Overall 
  Overall doing the WODs and learning JavaScript has help me improved on my coding skills. I hope to learn more from JavaScript and the WODs. There a lot things that I still neeed to learn but I feel that I have made huge steps toward improving myself. So that one day I can be promoted from newbie to pro coder in no time.
