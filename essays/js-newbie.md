# Thoughts on JavaScript

  This is the first time that I ever used JavaScript and I'm loving it so far. It's fast and easy to understand compared to Java and C. A first time programmer would probably understand JavaScript way easier then both Java and C. But I realized that you can also make easy mistakes here as well. Because JavaScript gets rid of many redundant coding such as naming all the variables by using let, it opens up many opportunities for coders to make mistake if they are not careful.
