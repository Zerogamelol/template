## Smart Questions?

  There is the old saying said by Carl Sagan "There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question". I believe that this quote is true, that there are no dumb questions. So what is a smart question? Well the way I think of it is that a smart question is a question that is asked the smart way. So what is a smart way to ask questions? After reading How to ask questions the smart way by Eric Raymound, I think that asking a question in a informative and concise way, as well as showing in your question that you put effort in trying to solving the problem using different resources available to you, is what asking a smart question is. 
 
## The Smart Way
  
   [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45568008/why-do-generic-methods-and-generic-types-have-different-type-introduction-syntax) is an example of a smart question. The header of the question is on point and short. The question shows that developer had gone through documentations and resources online to solve the problem but still couldn't solve it. The developer has shown that he/she can think for themselves and had done research and tried to understand but still couldn't solve the problem. The developer also pastes the documentation used and code example to better illustrate the problem. It also states the end goal, that the developer wants to understand Why do generic methods and generic types have different type introduction syntax. Which is good that it's actually the header of the question.
