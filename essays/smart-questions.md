## Smart Questions?

  There is the old saying said by Carl Sagan "There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question". I believe that this quote is true, that there are no dumb questions. So what is a smart question? Well the way I think of it is that a smart question is a question that is asked the smart way. So what is a smart way to ask questions? After reading How to ask questions the smart way by Eric Raymound, I think that asking a question in a informative and concise way, as well as showing in your question that you put effort in trying to solving the problem using different resources available to you, is what asking a smart question is. 
 
## The Smart Way
  
   [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45912510/does-java-jit-cheat-when-running-jdk-code) is an example of a smart question.
   
## Overall 
  Overall doing the WODs and learning JavaScript has help me improved on my coding skills. I hope to learn more from JavaScript and the WODs. There a lot things that I still neeed to learn but I feel that I have made huge steps toward improving myself. So that one day I can be promoted from newbie to pro coder in no time.
