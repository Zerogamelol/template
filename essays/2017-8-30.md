The first time I ever experienced programming was back in Middle School. Our Computer teaccher taught us how to design a website using HTML. I was bored out of my mind. Maybe my teacher made coding boring to me or maybe I was just impatient back then but coding did not interest me at all. That all changed however when I first took a class in Web Design during High School. Back then I was dead set on becoming a Graphic Designer, so I took elecitive classes that improved my artistic and creative abilities. One of these classes were of course, Web Design. At first I wasn't very keen on taking the class but my advisor highly recommended the class to me.
