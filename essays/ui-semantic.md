## Thoughts on Semantic UI
My thoughts on Semantic UI is that its very easy to use but hard to master. It was hard to find the right classes to use for the specific purpose that I want to do. Even if I did find the right class that I wanted to use, it still didn't work the way I wanted. I had to keep fixing my code until I got it to work. Sure it is easier to use then just raw HTML and CSS but you have more control in HTML and CSS compared to Semantic UI. However, there are many classes in Semantic UI that are beneficial like Grids and Icons. Overall I think for me the frustration of getting things to work in Semantic outweight to benefits.
