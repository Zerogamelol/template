## Blowing-Up
  First impressions of Meteor was that it is an impressive application architecture. A person can develope a website easily with Meteor. I was blown away with how much you can do with Meteor. I also learned a lot by studying Meteor code. I learned the interactions between client and server just by doing Meteor coding. So my intials thoughts on Meteor were pretty high until of course, it stopped working. 

## Extinction of productivity
  Like the asteroid that came and killed the dinosaurs a long long time ago, Meteor effectively reduced the amount of work I did to zero. Intially I didn't have any problems with Meteor on Windows 10, but after awhile it stopped working. I tried for days trying to fix the problem, uninstalling/reinstalling Meteor and Windows, looked and used various solutions on the internet, asked for help from fellow collegues, to no avail. Thus an entire week of not coding, which in turn gave me a bunch of work to catch up on. What's more it takes awhile for Meteor to load. Pile that in with IntelliJ leads to a very long wait time for Windows users. For me, I have had enough and switched to Ubuntu and run perfectly.... too perfectly.... 
  
## Final-Thoughts
  Meteor is great way learn many of the inner workings of application design. Its easy to run and manage... for Linux and Mac users. For Windows users, good luck making it work and hit me up when you do.
